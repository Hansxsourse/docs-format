# DCT Academy's Documentation Format

This repository provides best practices for writing documentation and basic folder structure that has to be followed while writing Node app (or any app in general). 

**Note:** You can use a tool like [README.md Genearator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator) to ease up your process.

In order to write documentation on GitHub, you have to first understand Markdown, a standard used by GitHub to accept documentation. 

* Learn more about Markdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Learn how to use Markdown [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
* Find Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Examples of a good documentation:
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) GitHub repository
* [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) GitHub repository
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) GitHub repository

> Do not include the above paragraph in your documentation.

# Project Title

Write your project overview here. A short description about your project and what it does. It should also provide details, links, algorithms or other resources like tutorials, links to articles and research papers, used in the application.

One to two paragraph statement about your product and what it does. Add a screenshot (user logged in) as shown below.

# Installation/Development

Imagine a new developer who wants to use/run your project. It's a good practice to write all the tools, dependencies and versions of packages that you have used in your app. You can exclude trivial dependencies and only include that you have used specific to this project. There are chances that the developer might be using a different operating system or an environment.

Operating System 1:

```
npm install <package-name>
```

Operating System 2:

```
npm install <package-name>
```
Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated suite. Potentially do this for multiple platforms

* Packages 1/Dependencies 1
* Packages 2/Dependencies 2
* Packages 3/Dependencies 3
* .
* .
* Packages N/Dependencies N

# Usage 
Write a brief description on how to use your project/app. Write about the features involved, different ways of using your app. Explain like you are explaining this to your customer or client. Use bullet points if necessary.

[Demo](https://<demo-link>.com)

Post a demo link along with demo login credentials if your app is successfully deployed.
